# KISS Principle
The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) Principle is a fundamental design philosophy that emphasizes simplicity in software development. The core idea behind KISS is that systems work best when they are kept simple rather than made complex. By avoiding unnecessary complexity, developers can create software that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
