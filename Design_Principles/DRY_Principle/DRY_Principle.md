# DRY Principle
The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle is a fundamental software design principle aimed at reducing redundancy in code. It emphasizes the importance of having a single, unambiguous representation of any piece of knowledge or logic within a system. By adhering to the DRY principle, developers can create more maintainable, scalable, and efficient codebases.
