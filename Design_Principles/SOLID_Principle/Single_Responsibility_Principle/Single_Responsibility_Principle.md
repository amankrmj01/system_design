# Single Responsibility Principle
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job. By adhering to this principle, software becomes more modular, easier to understand, and maintainable. 

## Key Concepts
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class should focus on a single task or responsibility, making it easier to manage and modify.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different responsibilities should be handled by different classes, promoting a clear separation of concerns within the codebase.
- **Cohesion**: Classes should be cohesive, meaning that all their methods and properties should relate to a single purpose.        

## Benefits
- **Improved Maintainability**: With each class having a single responsibility, it becomes easier to locate and fix bugs or make changes without affecting other parts of the system.
- **Enhanced Readability**: Code that follows SRP is generally easier to read and understand, as each class has a clear purpose.
- **Reduced Complexity**: By breaking down responsibilities into smaller, focused classes, the overall complexity of the system is reduced.
- **Easier Testing**: Classes with a single responsibility are easier to test in isolation, leading to more reliable and maintainable tests.
- **Better Reusability**: Classes designed with SRP in mind can often be reused in different contexts, as they encapsulate specific functionality without unnecessary dependencies.
