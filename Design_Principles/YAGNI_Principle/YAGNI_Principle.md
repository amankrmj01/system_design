# YAGNI Principle
The YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) Principle is a key concept in software development that encourages developers to avoid implementing features or functionality until they are actually needed. The principle is rooted in the idea that adding unnecessary features can lead to over-engineering, increased complexity, and wasted resources. By adhering to the YAGNI principle, developers can keep their codebases lean, maintainable, and focused on current requirements.
