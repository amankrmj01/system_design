# Architecture Patterns
This section explores various architecture patterns used in system design. Each pattern is explained with its characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and use cases. The architecture patterns covered in this section include:

- [Monolithic Architecture](Monolithic_Architecture/Monolithic_Architecture.md)
- [Microservices Architecture](Microservices_Architecture/Microservices_Architecture.md)
- [Event-Driven Architecture](Event-Driven_Architecture/Event-Driven_Architecture.md)
- [Serverless Architecture](Serverless_Architecture/Serverless_Architecture.md)
- [Layered (N-Tier) Architecture](Layered_Architecture/Layered_Architecture.md)
- [Client-Server Architecture](Client-Server_Architecture/Client-Server_Architecture.md)
- [Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)](Service-Oriented_Architecture/Service-Oriented_Architecture.md)
- [Peer-to-Peer Architecture](Peer-to-Peer_Architecture/Peer-to-Peer_Architecture.md)
- [Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)](Hexagonal_Architecture/Hexagonal_Architecture.md)
- [CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Architecture](CQRS_Architecture/CQRS_Architecture.md)
