# Bridge Design Pattern
The Bridge Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. This pattern is useful when both the abstraction and the implementation may change frequently, and it helps to avoid a permanent binding between them.
