# Decorator Design Pattern
The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is useful for adhering to the Open/Closed Principle by enabling the extension of an object's functionality without modifying its structure.
