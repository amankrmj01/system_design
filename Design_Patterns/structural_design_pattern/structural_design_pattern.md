# Structural Design Patterns
 
 Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same. This section explores various structural design patterns, including Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy patterns, along with their implementations in Java.

## Introduction
Structural design patterns provide solutions to object composition problems in software design. By using these patterns, developers can create flexible and efficient structures that promote code reuse and maintainability.


 ## Types of Structural Design Patterns
 - [Adapter Pattern](adapter_design_pattern/Adapter_Design_Pattern.md)
 - [Bridge Pattern](bridge_design_pattern/Bridge_Design_Pattern.md)
 - [Composite Pattern](composite_design_pattern/Composite_Design_Pattern.md)
 - [Decorator Pattern](decorator_design_pattern/Decorator_Design_Pattern.md)
 - [Facade Pattern](facade_design_pattern/Facade_Design_Pattern.md)
 - [Flyweight Pattern](flyweight_design_pattern/Flyweight_Design_Pattern.md)
 - [Proxy Pattern](proxy_design_pattern/Proxy_Design_Pattern.md)


## Benefits
 - **Flexibility**: Structural patterns allow for more flexible and dynamic object composition.
 - **Code Reusability**: These patterns promote code reuse by providing standard ways to compose objects.
 - **Maintainability**: They help in maintaining the system by reducing dependencies between components.
 - **Efficiency**: Some structural patterns, like Flyweight, optimize resource usage.

## When to Use
 - When the system needs to be independent of how its objects are composed.
- When the system should be configured with one of multiple object compositions.
- When the composition process is complex and requires multiple steps.
