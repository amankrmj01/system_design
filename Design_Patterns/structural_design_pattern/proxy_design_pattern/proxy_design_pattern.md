# Proxy Design Pattern
The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern is useful when you want to add an additional layer of functionality, such as lazy loading, access control, or logging, without modifying the original object's code.
