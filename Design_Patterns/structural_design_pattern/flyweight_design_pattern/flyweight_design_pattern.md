# Flyweight Design Pattern
The Flyweight Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that aims to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. It is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that have identical or similar properties, allowing for efficient resource management and improved performance.
