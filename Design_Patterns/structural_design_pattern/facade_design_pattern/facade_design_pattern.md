# Facade Design Pattern
The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It acts as a front-facing interface that hides the complexities of the underlying code and makes it easier to use. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with large codebases or libraries, as it helps to reduce dependencies and improve code readability.
