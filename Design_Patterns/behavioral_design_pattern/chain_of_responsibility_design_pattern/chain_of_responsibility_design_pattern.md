# Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles the request. This pattern decouples the sender of the request from its receiver, promoting flexibility and scalability in handling requests.
