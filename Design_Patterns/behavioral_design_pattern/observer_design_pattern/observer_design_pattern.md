# Observer Design Pattern
The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing multiple observer objects to be notified and updated automatically when the state of a subject object changes. This pattern promotes loose coupling and enhances the flexibility of the system.
