## Introduction
System design is a critical skill for software engineers, especially when building large-scale applications. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to designing systems using Java, leveraging its robust ecosystem and libraries.

## Architecture Patterns
This section explores various architecture patterns such as Monolithic, Microservices, Event-Driven, and Serverless architectures. Each pattern is explained with Java-based examples and use cases.

## Design Principles
Here, we discuss fundamental design principles like SOLID, DRY, KISS, and YAGNI, and how to apply them in Java projects to create maintainable and scalable systems.

## Design Patterns
This section covers common design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy patterns, with Java implementations and real-world scenarios.
- [Creational Design Patterns](creational_design_pattern/creational_design_pattern.md)
- [Structural Design Patterns](structural_design_pattern/structural_design_pattern.md)
- [Behavioral Design Patterns](behavioral_design_pattern/behavioral_design_pattern.md)  

## Data Storage Solutions
We explore different data storage options including relational databases, NoSQL databases, and in-memory data stores, along with Java libraries and frameworks for interacting with these storage solutions.

## Caching Strategies
This section discusses various caching strategies like in-memory caching, distributed caching, and cache invalidation techniques, with examples using Java caching libraries such as Ehcache and Redis.

## Concurrency and Multithreading
Concurrency is essential for building high-performance systems. This section covers Java's concurrency utilities, thread management, and best practices for writing thread-safe code.

## APIs and Microservices
This section focuses on designing RESTful APIs and microservices using Java frameworks like Spring Boot. It includes best practices for API design, versioning, and security.

## Testing and Monitoring
Effective testing and monitoring are crucial for maintaining system reliability. This section covers unit testing, integration testing, and monitoring tools and techniques for Java applications.
